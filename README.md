My name is Ben, and I'm a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Warwick in the [Astronomy and Astophysics group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/).

I am currently working on detecting [circumbinary planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumbinary_planet) via the [transit method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_transit), using data from NASA's [TESS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/). This involves a lot of data processing and analysis, which means I write a lot of code! (mostly in Python)

I am currently doing this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) (although I am a few days behind!).
